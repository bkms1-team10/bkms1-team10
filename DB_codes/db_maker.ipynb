I am obsessed with Lake and Manning. Book #3 is releasing on 10/23 so if you\\'ve been waiting to start this series, don\\'t delay! \\n \"Ten months. That was how long I\\'d gone without a fix. Lake\\'s letters came every couple weeks. I\\'d opened the first one, but that was it. I\\'d known right then that if I was going to make it through this, I couldn\\'t think of her. Couldn\\'t be inside her head that way, and she definitely couldn\\'t be inside mine.\" \\n My heart broke for Lake and Manning. They endured years apart and obstacles at every turn. I honestly do not know what will happen, but I can\\'t wait to find out! \\n \"But he was still the one who could get everything I wanted with one word from Lake.\" \\n This is the kind of book that I read every chance I could. The characters are all believable and very real. The California setting was described perfectly. I simply could not put this book down!!! Highly recommend this series for contemporary romance readers. I\\'m a Jessica Hawkins fan for life!! \\n \" I couldn\\'t tell her I loved her. I couldn\\'t tell her I didn\\'t. It killed me, but that was how it was. It wasn\\'t going to be any other way, no matter how many times she put me in this goddamn position.\" \\n Favorite quote: \\n \"Maybe one day, Manning and I would challenge fate, defy gravity, and move the stars ourselves. But today was not that day.\"')\n",
      "('2', '01ec1a320ffded6b2dd47833f2c8e4fb', '32993133', 5, '4.5 Stars!! \\n \"Was sixteen too young to fall in love? I might\\'ve thought so before Manning. Could he love me back, a man seven years older? I was sure if he did, he\\'d never admit it. But I would wait for him. Even I understood that for a while, our ages mattered.\" \\n As a longtime fan of Jessica Hawkins, I just knew I would love this book. And from the very first page, I was totally hooked. What a delight! A slow-burn, forbidden romance. My favorite! \\n This is the kind of book where the author takes her time describing a first meeting, a small moment, a conversation. Nothing is simply told, it is shown. I flew through this book, absolutely breathless with anticipation at what would happen next! \\n Lake and Tiffany are two sisters who both meet Manning at the same time. There\\'s just one problem: Lake is only 16 years old. And Manning is a handsome construction worker with a past. \\n He half-smiled, one corner of his mouth lifting. That was the first I saw of his straight, white teeth. My heart skipped. Under the dirt, the sweat, the calluses, he was handsome. I\\'d known it already, peripherally, as I knew the direction of the beach or the artwork hanging in my dad\\'s office. But now it was right in front of me. I couldn\\'t miss it.\" \\n Lake is a good girl: smart, studious and obedient. Tiffany is the wild child. But the interactions with their parents are nuanced and there is more to them than their labels. Although Tiffany seems flighty, she is much more appropriate for Manning than Lake. But who will get his heart? \\n \"Manning leaned his elbows onto his knees and watched her approach. My sister had that effect on men. They were always looking over or around me to see her. What\\'d he think when he looked at her? What\\'d he notice first?\" \\n I rarely have time to read a series back to back. But this book was so gripping and intense that I am immediately picking up the next book! I am obsessed with these characters and their story! \\n \"Some invisible tether existed between us. Nobody could see it, not even us, but I felt it. I was sure Manning did, too. As long as we both knew it, that was enough for me. For now, at least.\" \\n Highly recommend this one. It has great pacing, a real setting and a gripping story. Don\\'t miss it!! \\n \"It was a promise. No matter what, the story would only ever be about us.')\n",

A must-read! \\n \"You wanted me to move on, so I did, and I no longer need you. You can\\'t have it both ways.\" \\n All the love to Jessica Hawkins for crafting an unforgettable and heart-wrenching love story. This series spans decades and is truly one of my favorite contemporary romance sagas ever. Lake and Manning have an emotional connection that is stunning, heartbreaking and simply beautiful. \\n How to write a review that is completely spoiler-free? Just know that this series kept me up many nights reading because I just had to know how Lake and Manning\\'s epic journey was going to end. From two completely different worlds, these two only ever needed each other. Even if real life constantly got in their way. \\n \"I didn\\'t know it would turn out this way, Lake. Your life, and mine, nothing is how I thought it would be.\" \\n I literally read the books in this series back to back, and honestly had no clue where the author would take me as a reader. Ms. Hawkins stayed true to her main characters and developed the secondary characters perfectly. Dare I say that Tiffany was misunderstood? And that I would love to see a story based around her as well as Corbin? (But not together!) But this is Manning and Lake\\'s story and I lived and breathed them for every page of this gorgeous story. Angst, joy, true love, heartbreak, despair - this series has it all and then some. \\n \"These are the pieces, and they might not look like much to you, but they\\'re all I have. I\\'ve found a way to be happy. You can\\'t come back into my life and tell me it\\'s a mess when you\\'re the one who created it.\" \\n Manning is one of THE sexiest and most unforgettable main characters I\\'ve ever read. The self-sacrifice and heartache he endures is almost unbearable! And I literally felt as if I was THERE during the New York City scenes. \\n \"I thought I\\'d never have you, Lake, you have to understand that. I thought there was no chance. That people like me didn\\'t get a life like this.\" \\n Jessica Hawkins doesn\\'t take any shortcuts and it shows in her writing. Nothing in this series felt rushed, forced or left undone. Every event felt necessary and fit perfectly. This is not an easy story to read - there is heartache, cheating, and tons of angst - but it was gripping and completely satisfying. If you love an adult, very sexy story with real depth and brutal honesty, then don\\'t miss this series. And now I might actually have to do a re-read! \\n \"You and me, we\\'re you and me. Nobody\\'s earned the right to know our story.\"')\n",

That being said, this hot sports romance is a standalone so you can still enjoy this book even if you haven\\'t read any of the books in the series. \\n Lana\\'s family\\'s racing team is in desperate need of a driver. It\\'s up to Lana to prove herself to her father and her brothers to find the best driver there is for their team. Chance leads her to Racer, famous in the world of illegal street racing. He\\'s simply the best. \\n Lana takes a huge risk and hates Racer for her formula race car team. I loved the fast-paced description of the world of racing! Traveling all over the world for the races, Lana can hardly resist Racer, when he sets his sights on her and decides she\\'s The One for him. \\n \"This is illegal,\" I state. \\n His voice is husky from exertion, and his eyes glint with laughter. \"That\\'s why it\\'s fun.\" \\n Lana has a very protective family and a very sad past. But Racer Tate isn\\'t going to let anything stop him. He also has a lot of secrets he\\'s keeping, ones that will not only threaten his relationship with Lana but also his racing career. Will Lana and Racer be able to survive and overcome the obstacles that are in their way? \\n One of the things I love about Katy Evans is how she creates sexual tension with her characters. And it is off the charts here! Racer is intense on and off the racetrack, and Lana doesn\\'t stand a chance! \\n \"Crasher ...\" He warns, sounding a little cocky. \"You go out with me and you\\'ll never look back. I swear, baby.\" \\n I enjoyed this sexy, passionate story very much. There is low angst so if you are in the mood for a sizzling sports romance with wit and crackling sexual chemistry, then you will LOVE Racer!! And fans of the \\'Real\\' series will adore the way the cherished characters make appearances here. Happy reading! \\n \"I\\'m Racer Tate and this girl is mine.')\n",

I want to live in blissful denial.\" \\n I am not a fan of over-the-top drama or crazy plots. So imagine my delight when I read \\'Fallen Heir\\' almost in one sitting! Addictive, funny and fast-paced, this book might be my favorite in the series so far. \\n Easton Royal is a high school senior at the very exclusive Astor Park Prep. This is a school filled with ultra-rich students complete with trust funds and designer clothes and huge mansions. Easton is a flirt and a partier and sets his sights on the new girl in school, Hartley. They are complete opposites but that is part of the fun of this book. Hartley is not at all interested in bad-boy Easton so he settles for the friend zone. \\n \"I need to treat her as a friend. A real, give-a-shit-about-each-other, don\\'t-need-to-be-naked-to-care-about-you friend.\" \\n This book should not be read as a standalone because it does contain some spoilers from the earlier books. I am SO glad I stuck with this series because I LOVED Easton\\'s story! He has a good heart and realizes that his partying is getting out of hand, especially as the son of a mother who had severe addiction issues. I fell in love with Easton and my heart broke for him!! \\n \"I\\'m the only one here, drinking crap I can\\'t stand because I don\\'t want to spend a minute of my life alone. My head\\'s a bad, bad place.\" \\n I really felt the connection between Easton and Hartley and loved the supporting characters. \\'Fallen Heir\\' is a crisply written and juicy story that is perfect for all fans of contemporary Young Adult books. This book just clicked for me. And I loved how funny Easton was. His humor and satire was just what this story needed. \\n \"I might be small, but I have the lung capacity of a whale, so if you don\\'t move I\\'m gonna have to release the oral Kraken until the entire school is in this hallway rescuing me from you.\" \\n I crack up. \"The oral Kraken? That sounds pretty dirty.\" \\n \"I\\'m thinking everything sounds dirty to you,\" she says dryly.\" \\n This nook ends on a MAJOR cliffhanger which should not be a surprise for fans of this series. WOW!! But never fear, another book is coming in January!! I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it if you\\'re looking for a very smart and witty Young Adult story. \\n \"I\\'m the design flaw in the Royal family, the one who isn\\'t quite like the others, the one who crashes and burns more often than not.\" \\n (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)')\n",

Really FANTASTIC erotic scenes and overall I liked it. If menage is your jam, you will love this series. I absolutely tore through the first two books in this series and could not wait for the conclusion! \\n Many readers adored this third book which is mainly Ash\\'s point of view. I\\'m still not quite sure what to say other than I was not really prepared for the turn of events that occurred in this story. Yes I LOVED the characters but some of the events seemed a little too fantastical for me. \\n The writing is complex and well-done and I loved the play on the King Arthur legend. At its heart this is the story of forbidden love and Greer, Embry and Ash are characters that I won\\'t soon forget. \\n Sierra Simone took the famous legend of King Arthur and put her own sexy, passionate spin on the legendary characters. There is betrayal, love, passion and heartbreak - this series has it all. \\n American Prince ended on a heartbreaking cliffhanger but I absolutely loved how the author continued this storyline into Ash\\'s book. These three are clearly destined to be together and I could not accept any other conclusion to their story! \\n \"What am I supposed to do? When the man who is supposed to love me hates me? When I can\\'t protect the woman we both love?\" \\n So many forces conspire to pull Ash, Greer and Embry apart. But they simply could not live without each other. This book was filled with surprises and all in all, I loved this series. These books were stunning and sexy and highly erotic. There\\'s lots and lots of kink but the series is very intelligent and very readable. Highly recommend for all erotic romance readers! \\n \"I see the beginning. \\n And I see the end.\" \\n (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)')\n",

All of my favorite characters make an appearance though and the way the author ties everything together was incredibly satisfying. \\n AJ is pursuing her dreams of headlining as an acrobatic dancer in a Las Vegas show. For now, she\\'s just one of the performers in a Cirque du Soleil-type show. But she dreams big. And nothing and no one will deter her from her dreams. \\n A Vegas casino is like its own planet--a virtually inescapable planet without obvious exit points. The sun or moon never makes an appearance, so the essence of time is completely lost. People are always milling about, and if it weren\\'t for the coffee and pastry cart that opens at dawn and shuts down at noon, it would be impossible to tell morning from night. \\n Braeden is only in town for a short time on military leave. He is instantly drawn to AJ\\'s wit and beauty and drive. He is not interested in a long-term commitment because he knows he can be shipped out anytime. I loved when these two met because they are both funny, driven and just very REAL. \\n \"You think too much.\" He angles his upper body toward me, opening his chest and torso for my viewing pleasure. Not that seeing him is pleasurable. It\\'s not that; it\\'s . . . he clearly works out or he was blessed with fantastic genes. Not that I\\'m noticing. Or care. Whatever. \\n I really felt their intense connection which is SO important for me. Their chemistry is scorching hot but more than that, they share an emotional connection. Even though they both try to deny it. \\n \"I don\\'t need promises. I only want to live in this moment with you, whatever that means, and not think about tomorrow or a week or a year from now.\" \\n Circumstances and a series of miscommunications lead to Braeden and AJ being separated. JB Salsbury added just the right amount of angst so that the story moved forward but never felt forced. And can I say that I really liked AJ\\'s boss, Andre? I felt that he was a little misunderstood and I can definitely feel another story there! \\n Braeden and AJ both have to overcome tragedy and curveballs thrown in their way. But their story is ultimately uplifting and inspiring and very, very emotional. Braeden especially was SO inspiring. \\n \"You\\'ll be okay. We\\'re going to get through this. We\\'re gonna fight our way through this because we know no other way. And we\\'re gonna do it together.\" \\n Fans of the Fighting Series will LOVE how this series ends. \\'The Final Fight\\' is fast-paced, sexy and funny in all the right places. I loved Braeden and AJ and their inspiring journey. \\n \"I will die before I let you go, you hear me? You\\'ll be back. You\\'ll be fighting for this shit too, but until you\\'re there, until you get your fight back, I\\'m fighting for you.\" \\n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)')\n",

Without question. And she returns to her Young Adult stories in \\'Without Merit\\'. Merit Voss is a teenage girl who in addition to the normal angst of young adulthood, lives in a very unconventional household. From her perspective, her family is just plain WEIRD. No one can seem to get along and most poignantly, no one really seems to notice Merit at all. She almost seems like an afterthought. \\n \"I can say with certainty that we live in the most unusual house in this whole town. I say house because it is certainly not a home. And inside this house are seven of the most unusual occupants. No one would be able to determine from the outside of our house that our family of seven includes an atheist, a home wrecker, an ex-wife suffering from a severe case of agoraphobia, and a teenage girl whose weird obsession borders on necrophilia. \\n Of course, Merit is a classic unreliable narrator and slowly the truth about her family emerges. Colleen Hoover knows how to treat delicate subjects with great dignity and care. She makes the entire cast of odd characters here sympathetic and very likable even though you may think the opposite of them at first. \\n Merit decides to just stop attending school. No one seems to even notice! While skipping school she meets a cute guy and they share an earth-shattering kiss. BUT Merit actually has a twin sister named Honor and the cute guy is actually Sagan, her twin\\'s boyfriend. It seems as though Sagan might have thought he was kissing Honor. \\n Merit is angry and surly and can\\'t seem to make many friends. She is offended when Sagan starts eating meals with the family and basically moving in. How could this have happened? \\n \"I\\'m confused by two things. One being the constant and repeated presence of Honor\\'s boyfriend at our breakfast table. Two being the fact that everyone seems to know him so well that they\\'re perfectly fine with him joining in on the family conversation. \\n Merit eventually uncovers some very hard truths about her family\\'s past. It also becomes very clear that Honor is not the perfect person that she at first thinks herself to be. Like all of Colleen Hoover\\'s characters, Merit is unforgettable. She must make some hard choices about herself, her family and Sagan. \\n \"Sagan just doesn\\'t say mean things out loud. Maybe that\\'s a product of how he was raised. Or maybe he\\'s some kind of saint. Or an angel brought to earth to test my morals.\" \\n I loved the message of this book!! The story is beautiful and the characters feel real and flawed and very relatable. The description of small-town Texas seems spot-on. Fans of Colleen Hoover will devour this story, and hopefully new readers will pick this one up and see why her readers are so devoted to her writing. Unconditional love, loyalty and forgiveness are some heavy topics but Ms. Hoover serves them up perfectly here. \\n \"Not every mistake deserves a consequence. Sometimes the only thing a mistake deserves is forgiveness.\" \\n ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.')\n",

Often I am reluctant to read a book that is part of a series BUT the author does a great job of filling in the stories of the whole Lund clan. \\n Loved the premise of this book! Jensen Lund is a pro football and has firm dating rules. No single mothers, no cheerleaders AND no medical professionals. He is a football superstar who has been sidelined by an injury, and is recovering from surgery. Rowan Michaels is a beautiful single mom who also happens to be a professional cheerleader AND who also works in the field of athletic training!! The complete opposite of everything that Jensen thinks he needs. \\n Rowan is smart, tough and very professional. She has rules, too, like NEVER dating professional athletes. She is raising her young son on her own and has zero interest in men like Jensen. Excerpt that once she gets to know him, she realizes that he is smart, sensitive and driven - just like her. There is one big obstacle to their relationship, though - the football team has a very strict no-franternization rule between players and cheerleaders. \\n Rowan and Jensen both live the same apartment complex so they are neighbors. Hard to avoid each other, right? I loved that there was no insta-love here, but instead Rowan and Jensen\\'s relationship was allowed to build and grow throughout the book. Ms. James is an incredible writer and she really created a wonderful story with these characters. I loved the slow-build romance between these two. And Rowan\\'s adorable son added some light-hearted moments to the story. \\n Will Rowan and Jensen sacrifice their friendship for their professional careers? I adored the conclusion to this story! And the Lund family was captivating. This book is also super-sexy and has enticed me to start the other books in the series. A definite must-read for all contemporary romance lovers! \\n \"Ask me why I stayed away this week.\" \\n \"Why did you stay away this week?\" \\n \"Because I\\'m a shitty friend.\" \\n \"Why are you a shitty friend?\" \\n \"Because I don\\'t want to be friends with you.

Did you ever stop to think maybe it\\'s me who will break your heart someday?\" \\n WOW!!!! I fell in love with Vi Keeland\\'s writing with \"Worth the Fight\\' a few years ago, and \\'Beautiful Mistake\\' highlights the BEST of her talents!! Sexxxxy romance, relatable characters, a great story...and a twist that I never saw coming. \\n I have read so many student/teacher stories lately but this book is SO much more!! Caine is a music professor and Rachel is his graduate student Teaching Assistant. I absolutely loved the them of music that ran through the book. How does music make you feel? What memories does music bring back for the listener? But this story is much more than the taboo relationship between Caine and Rachel. Both have secrets that are very slowly revealed through the book. How will those secrets affect their relationship? \\n Rachel has had a tough life and she is one feisty character! Funny. beautiful, kind and loving, she has made her share of mistakes but can\\'t resist Caine\\'s sex appeal. The dialogue is smart, light where it needs to be and the supporting characters are perfect. \\n \"Calm down in there. He isn\\'t inviting you to a romantic dinner. He only wants you to help with his nieces. Put on a diaper, not take off your clothes.\" \\n I was surprised by the depth and emotion in this story. Rachel and Caine\\'s story will stay with me for a long time. Bravo, Ms. Keeland. Highly recommend \\'Beautiful Mistake\\'!! \\n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)')\n",

I DEVOUR her books. And this one started off very strong for me! I loved the premise of the story: ugly-duckling Rana finds her childhood friend Landon online when she is drunk one night and calls him and unleashes years of pent-up frustration. Rana grew up very poor in Michigan and her family rented their apartment from Landon\\'s family. She was forced to suddenly move when she was young and lost touch with her former best friend Landon. \\n However, the truth turns out to be a little different than what Rana was told and she and Landon begin to talk on the phone and it becomes very clear they both have very strong feelings for each other. \\n Penelope Ward is the queen of second-chance romance as well as creating a sold backstory for her characters. I didn\\'t quite feel that connection between Rana and Landon but many readers loved this one so definitely give it a try. The story has some very valuable messages about self-esteem and forgiveness. And the sexy times are incredibly HOT!! I would have liked a little more build-up to the full-blown relationship between Landon and Rana. BUT I did fall in the love with Landon: like all of Ms. Ward\\'s main characters, he is simply unforgettable!! \\n His hands may have been calloused; his arms may have been inked; he may have looked dangerous, but Landon was as gentle as he was protective. \\n \\'Drunk Dial\\' is a light and sexy story that delivers a HEA. While it is not my favorite Penelope Ward book, I nonetheless enjoyed reading it and loved the second-chance, friends to lovers storyline. This is a sexy, passionate and often funny book with lots of emotion. Enjoy Landon Roderick! I know I did. \\n Our story was a lot like a Rubik\\'s Cube - colourful and complicated. It took years to work it out, but then suddenly like magic, on a random Sunday, everything all came together. \\n (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)')\n",

Vi Keeland and Penelope Ward cooked up another very readable yet super-hot contemporary romance. \\n Dr. Simon Hogue is a sexy British physician who meets single-mom Bridget in the cutest way possible. Both are single: Bridget is a widowed nurse with not much of a social life and Simon is a gorgeous doctor with no interest in a relationship. \\n There\\'s tons of humor, sexy talk and a hottie British doctor. What\\'s not to love? After an embarrassing \"meet cute\" with Simon, Bridget ends up renting a room in her home to him in order to make ends meet. It\\'s not permanent: Simon is only in the US to complete his residency and then he will be back off to Britain. He loves to tease Bridget and their attraction is mutual. So he proposes a deal: a no-strings attached, sex-only relationship until he leaves. \\n The authors put a fresh spin on the friends-to-lovers trope that is sexy and enticing.

This is not so much a taboo romance as it is the story of two people who simply meet at the wrong time. Annie is an up-and-coming, career-driven architect who has no time for relationships. She has just never felt that \"spark\" with any man. Jack and Annie meet one night in a bar when she is out for a fun night with friends. They have an immediate connection that only Jodi-Ellen Malpas can make seem SO real. \\n Jack\\'s marriage was over long before he met Annie. While some might see this as a bright line that should never be crossed, Jack instead seemed to me to be sweet, vulnerable and craving an intimate connection. Annie for one cannot believe she has found herself in this situation but Jack is everything she never knew she wanted. \\n \"I would never have put myself in this situation for anything less than powerful love. The kind that keeps you going. The kind that gives you breath and life. Jack\\'s my life. He\\'s my pulse.

His story is a standalone, and does NOT feature any forbidden romance. Andrew is the complete opposite of Amelia, the boss of his sister and a total Type-A workaholic. She has been burned by a painful split from her husband and is going through a very difficult divorce. Amelia and Andrew make is clear from the start they are both only looking for a one-night stand, with no strings attached. Andrew does not suffer from lack of women, that\\'s for sure - he\\'s totally hot, has his own business and has an adorable daughter named Bell, who is raising on his own. \\n They are both completely honest with each other from the start but begin to develop a deeper connection. Their emotional relationship develops slowly, even though they both are wary of getting close. Amelia is stunning, smart and self-sufficient, Never in a million years does she think she could ever fall for a man like Andrew! And Andrew\\'s daughter comes first, even while it becomes obvious his daughter would love for him to fall in love. I loved that Andrew was the one who actually starts to realize that he is falling in love with Amelia and wants more from her. \\n Somewhere along the way, she became worth it to me. The threat of pain that comes with keeping her in my life--it\\'s not enough to scare me away. In fact, it\\'s the threat of competition that stokes a fire in me.

Devney Perry has become an auto-read author for me. I love her blend of sweet, sexy, Alphas and compulsively readable storylines with a bit of suspense thrown in. \\n \"This time around, I didn\\'t want her running to me as an escape. This time around, I wanted her to finally choose me just because I made her happy. \" \\n While the other characters from the earlier books make appearances here, this book can be read and enjoyed as a complete standalone.

There are a lot of external forces working against them. I loved watching a trust and friendship develop between them. This is just a gorgeous story, filled with scenes from a working ranch, life in Montana and even the dangers of addiction. This is a big, beautiful story, much like how I imagine life in small-town Montana to be! \\n \"I love that you get all shy when I give you a compliment,\" he said into my hair. \"But don\\'t hide that smile from me, Lis.

Highly recommend this one for fans of KA - this book is all about a strong heroine; a stand-up, Alpha hero; and some fast-moving danger. Loved the descriptions of the breathtaking Montana scenery. \\n I\\'m a HUGE fan of second-chance romance and this one fit the bill perfectly. This is the second book in the Jamison Valley series and centers around Nick, Jesse\\'s friend. (This book can be read as a standalone but I HIGHLY recommend the first book because it is fantastic!) It\\'s no spoiler that Nick and Emmeline (Emmy) were married in Las Vegas many years earlier and surprise! They meet up again very unexpectedly after many years apart, when she moves to his small town. \\n \"Nick?\" Gigi asked, but I didn\\'t speak or take my eyes off Emmy. She was frozen just like I was. Finally, Emmy broke away. \\n \"Sorry. I have to go,\" she mumbled before racing to the door. \\n \"What was that? Do you know her?\" Jess asked. \\n Yeah. I knew her. \"She\\'s my wife.\" \\n There is a delicious slow-burn aspect to this story even though Nick and Emmy are still legally married. Emmy now has a boyfriend, and had given up ever finding Nick after years of searching turned up nothing (there\\'s a good reason for that which is revealed later in the book!). Nick broke her heart when he left her after their impulsive wedding in Vegas. Emmy and Nick were from two very different worlds, but now their paths have crossed again when she takes a teaching job in Prescott, Montana. \\n Nick is a sexy and sweet Alpha but Emmy resists him despite his incredibly tender and romantic gestures. Even though they are husband and wife, they really didn\\'t know each other at all. If you are a fan of small-town romance, you will love this book. There is plenty of action and just the right amount of heat. Although story did not have the \"wow\" factor that \\'The Coppersmith Farmhouse\\' had, I still raced through this book and absolutely fell in love with the characters. \\n I am obsessed with this series and cannot wait for more stories about the other characters. Ms. Perry obviously has a great deal of love for her setting and it shows in her writing. \\'The Clover Chapel\\' is a heart-warming, funny, sexy and very adult romance that enthralled me and entertained me to the very last word. I am thrilled that the third book in the series, \\'The Lucky Heart\\' is coming in August! I can\\'t wait to return to Jamison Valley. \\n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)')\n",

But at the same time, I feel like if I could live through that, what happened to us, then I can survive anything. Like, what is there really to be afraid of?\" \\n This book has SO much going for it! A Bittersweet, friends-to-lovers story; a feisty and relatable heroine; AND a bad-boy hero. Kylie Scott is one of my favorite authors and \\'Lick\\' remains one of my top favorite contemporary romance books. For those reasons, I stuck with this story and I\\'m so glad that I did. Edie is VERY different from most fictional heroines and for that, I applaud Ms. Scott. For once, the ordinary girl gets the guy! \\n \"Kissing John was everything. Well, not everything everything. I wouldn\\'t die without him. But all of me wanted him, my heart and my head and all of the rest. Without a doubt, he made life better.\" \\n John and Edie experienced a life-changing trauma and it pretty much bonds them together. No one else can understand what they went through that fateful night at the convenience story and they have a tough time relating to their teachers, families and friends. They end up attending the same high school and I loved what the author had to say about bullying, fat-shaming and teenage angst. There are some light-hearted moments in this story as well and if Ms. Scott writes more YA novels, I will be first in line! With that said, there were some minor inconsistencies that took me out of the story a bit (there seemed to be some Aussie-speak thrown in - no American teenager uses some of the language that the author used) but all in all this was a sweet, funny and sexy romance that kept me turning the pages until the very end. \\n \"You\\'re here?\" \\n \"Yeah.\" \\n \"Why?\" \\n \"Because this is where you are,\" he said, as if it were obvious. \\n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)')\n",

Eve Dangerfield has a fresh and VERY unique voice and I adored this story. \\n \"You\\'re stunning,\" he said, eyeing her up and down. His irises weren\\'t watery blue like most redheads, but a warm caramel brown. Ash\\'s lady areas tingled, as though they too craved a cigarette. \\n \"Thanks.\" \\n Can I keep this review clean? Hard to do, based on how naughty this book is. Ashley is a hard-working nurse who has THE worst taste in men and decides she is finished with boyfriends. What she wants is a baby and a good sperm donor. A former model, Ash was a party girl but has always been sensitive about her lower-class background and loser parents. Raised by her grandmother, she and her sister Julia are best friends and share everything. \\n Julia\\'s boyfriend Max has a gorgeous red-headed roommate named Dean. A big lovable bear of a man, Dean has coasted through life but when he meets Ash, that\\'s IT for him. And Ash feels the same. A ginger? No way! \\n He wasn\\'t a pretty boy, his nose was crooked and his grin lopsided, but he had that square-jawed, salt-of-the-earth handsome look that made a girl think of loose-hipped cowboys and demanding Scottish Lairds. And speaking of Scottish Lairds, old mate was a redhead. Usually gingers weren\\'t her scene but this guy\\'s hair was the rich coppery-auburn of a fox\\'s pelt. It gleamed like rose gold under the floodlights, his short beard the exact colour as the stuff on his head. Big Red was doing it for her. Big time. And apparently, the feeling was mutual.\" \\n Dean is one of the most original MC\\'s I\\'ve ever had the pleasure of reading. Sensitive, kind, loving, he wears his heart on his sleeve. Trouble is, he has a tiny little problem focusing and drifts off right in the middle of a thought. Ash wants to use him but he wants more from her! What a fun change of pace from the usual contemporary romance books I read. \\n \"You women, always trying to rush straight to sex. Whatever happened to romance?\" \\n Dean and Ash were perfect together. There\\'s tons of Australian slang and references in this book but they did not distract from the story. Between the \\'Princess Bride\\' references, the Tessa Bailey mention and the hilarious and STEAMY sex scenes, this book was a win for me. The dialogue crackles and the characters are all well-written and so REAL. I can\\'t put my finger on what makes a book work for me, but \\'Open Hearts\\' has \"it.\" I couldn\\'t book this book down! Filled with heat, heart and humor, \\'Open Hearts\\' is one of my favorite books this year. \\n Favorite quotes: \\n \"He had to be six-four or five, lean, but beefy everywhere it counted. How would all that weight feel bearing down on her? She imagined his handsome face screwed up in pleasure as he pounded away at her practically revirginized p---y. Everything below her belly button tightened.\" \\n \"They\\'d tried to diagnose him but there was no apparent medical explanation for his behaviour. He was just what his mum called \\'away with the fairies\\' and Max called \\'a bit of a lost \\n c--t.\\'\" \\n \"You\\'re my dream girl, Ash. No one even comes close.\"')\n",

I loved this fun and spicy slow-burn sports romance!! \\'Illegal Contact\\' has the perfect mix of romance and heat. Any sports-romance lover will adore this story!! \\n Football superstar Gavin Brawley of the New York Barons has major anger issues. A tough guy who grew up in the foster system, he is caught on video assaulting a man and as a result, is put on six months of house arrest. What is was really doing was protecting his friend but Gavin will take his punishment even though it means he is suspending from playing football, the only thing that saved him from a life of total despair. \\n Most fans think Gavin is a total asshole. And he does little to nothing to dispel the public\\'s opinion of him. In reality, he is a deeply closeted bisexual who has just a few close friends in his inner circle. He trusts no one outside his tight-knit circle. But because Gavin is a prisoner in his own home (a stunning mansion in the Hamptons), he is forced by his long-time manager to hire a PA to shop for him, cook his meals and run his errands. But Gavin is dead-set against this idea because he really doesn\\'t like most people and he just wants to be left alone. \\n \"I was a multimillionaire and a famous athlete, and yet people still treated me like a dirt-poor street kid from Newark. Some things never changed.\" \\n Noah Monroe is in desperate need of a job. His last one ended badly and his father was just laid off. His student loans are looming over his head. He knows absolutely zero about football but that adds to his charm. And so he has no idea who Gavin Brawley is either. He is completely clueless but must find a job as soon as possible. He is out of options and will take any job, even if it is way outside his chosen field of social work. \\n \"Was that the celebrity I\\'d be servicing? Bad choice of words. Was that the celebrity I\\'d be . . . personally assisting? I wasn\\'t too clear on what this job would even entail. I\\'d just been told to send my resume and cover letter to Joe\\'s receptionist.\" \\n Of course Noah and Gavin cannot stand each other at first! Gavin is a total jerk to Noah. \\n \"The man I hired has worked for movie stars, Gavin. He understands discretion.\" \\n \"I don\\'t give a shit if he understands quantum physics. He\\'s more likely to land on the moon than set foot in this ridiculous mansion.\" \\n I adore an enemies-to-lovers story. Gavin and Noah could not be more different. Gavin tries to shut Noah out of his life but he has to admit, Noah begins to do an amazing job as his PA. Noah begins to answer the huge amount of fan mail that has been accumulating and starts a social media presence for Gavin. So the fans actually begin to like Gavin Brawley. Gavin is wildly attracted to Noah but as a closeted bisexual, he feels that coming out would ruin his football career. Santino Hassell does a fantastic job of building their relationship from intense dislike, to friendship, to sweet, sweet romance. I could not put this story down! The sex scenes are CRAZY hot. Even when Noah and Gavin were breaking my heart, I just knew these two had to have a HEA. And boy, did they ever. \\n I finished with my hands in his hair and our lips crushed together. It was an orgasm worthy of Olympic medals, but what really stopped my heart was the sound of my name in his lust-soaked voice. We were both in trouble. \\n When Gavin finally begins to trust Noah, it is a beautiful thing. The banter, the sexy flirting, the touches of humor - it all worked for me. There is a second book planned in this series for Gavin\\'s friend and teammate Simeon and let me just say that it sounds all kinds of awesome. I already miss these guys!! \\n Gavin cocked a brow. \"If you think I\\'m going to try to spare your delicate baby eyes, I suggest you readjust your expectations. FYI--after showering, I air dry.\"')\n",

I cannot believe this is my first Santino Hassell book!! I LOVE his writing style!! Don\\'t be put off by this being the fifth book in a series, it can stand alone in my opinion and also made me curious about the other books and characters in this amazing Five Boroughs world. \\n This story felt very modern and relevant, mainly because the MC Ashton is an Instagram \"star.\" He is rich, gorgeous, and his life looks fabulous. From the outside. In reality, he is the classic \"poor little rich boy,\" looking for true love and instead hooking up endlessly with meaningless one-night stands. \\n Val is a boxer from a poor family, the son of Ashton\\'s nanny. He grew up with Ash and has had a crush on him since they were kids. Val sees the \"real\" Ash, the kind, generous and loving boy that he grew up with. \\n \"The real Ashton--the quirky bastard with the smart-ass smile and thrift-store style--could get me to do anything. The Ashton he played for the rest of the world didn\\'t have the same power.\" \\n Ash is living a reckless life, filled with endless parties and endless men. Val will protect Ash at all costs, even at the expense of his intense training schedule. Val is a rising star in the boxing world and lives a clean lifestyle. \\n Val always felt like an outsider in Ashton\\'s world. Yet he was always there for him no matter what. Val never felt worthy of Ash and even though he has been secretly in love with Ash for years, Val doesn\\'t believe that Ash could ever love someone like him. \\n \"Even amid other rich folks and socialites, Ashton stole all the attention in the room. Elegant, and gorgeous, and so damn unique that people had paused in their own conversations to watch him approach. His presence was magnetic, and people were helplessly drawn to him. Myself included.\" \\n Much of this book is spent with the two MC\\'s in a dance around each other: both afraid to admit their true feelings BUT unable to deny the powerful attraction between them. The writing is beautiful and funny and painful all at once. Would these two gorgeous souls from very different worlds ever find their way back to each other? \\n \"I could never stop thinking about Ashton, and I would never stop missing the quiet moments when it was just us and he was a devastatingly beautiful force of nature that had calmed just for me. \\n Santino Hassell has now become a favorite author of mine. And I adore the SMOKING hot scenes between Ashton and Valdrin. OMG!! They burned up the pages. Bravo to you, Mr. Hassell! This book had everything I love about contemporary MM romance. Can\\'t wait to read more from this author. \\n \"He drew me into another kiss and, even with people flooding the space to surround us, I didn\\'t see anyone but him.\"')\n",

She has risen from her past tragedies and is determined to make her new business successful. But first she must convince Aaric to lend her the money to get her business off the ground. \\n Aaric is now very much involved with a wealthy socialite girlfriend but Bryn and Aaric have a past and knew each other years before. I loved the second-chance romance aspect of this story! Along with the New Your City setting, this was a perfectly enjoyable contemporary romance with Katy Evans\\' trademark brand of HOT sexiness. Will Bryn be able to put aside her personal feelings so that she and Aaric can keep things strictly business? \\n \"He\\'s the biggest what if I\\'ve ever had in my life. The one you always wonder about.\" \\n There\\'s some drama here but it works in the story. I loved Aaric\\'s point of view and feel that it really gave his character depth. He seemed so allofll of at first but then really became someone I was rooting for by the end. The sexy times are perfect and it all added up to a fast-paced and enjoyable contemporary romance. \\n I would have loved to have learned more about Aaric and Bryn when they were younger; the flashback scenes left me wanting more!

I honestly do not know what will happen, but I can\\'t wait to find out! \\n \"But he was still the one who could get everything I wanted with one word from Lake.\" \\n This is the kind of book that I read every chance I could. The characters are all believable and very real. The California setting was described perfectly. I simply could not put this book down!!!

I am a huge fan of Harper Sloan\\'s writing and her oh-so-sexy Alpha males so I had high hopes for this story. This is Maverick\\'s book, he is a famous bull rider on the rodeo circuit but must cut his career short due to injuries. \\n He returns home to the family and town he left behind and the sweet and beautiful Leigh, who has loved him since she was a young girl. She also happens to be Maverick\\'s sister\\'s best friend! \\n There are plenty of sweet, sexy times in this book but the central conflict was worked out pretty early on. There are also lots of down-home, small-town feels to this book and all in all, it was an easy, steamy read. Of course the best scenes are between Maverick and Leigh. This book was perfectly enjoyable but it just didn\\'t thrill me like Harper\\'s earlier books. \\'Lost Rider\\' is a great summertime read when you crave some sweet, country lovin\\'. \\n \"I can\\'t fix the past...

You can always count on this author to deliver a steamy, well-written story, and she lives up to her reputation with this yummy book. Surprisingly emotional yet funny and sharp, I enjoyed every minute of this fast-moving story. Eden Tate is stuck in a dead-end job that she hates. She is a smart and driven journalist but must land a big story in order to move up to a better position. She hears a rumor of a \"Mister Romance\", a mysterious man who acts as an escort to some of Manhattan\\'s wealthiest and elite women. She is determined to uncover his true identity. \\n Sounds cliche, no? But this story is much more than your standard rom-com. Eden has some heavy trust issues and \"M.R.\" actually beats her at her own game and turns the tables on her. And surprise! \\'M.R.\" aka Max Riley is sexy and smart and just might be the one who shows Eden how to open her heart. \\n This story had my heart pounding and had me cheering for Eden and Max. And the steamy scenes between Eden and Max are BURNING HOT!! I fell in love with all the characters in this book and their love story made me swoon.

She is required to enroll in college and attend class as part of her therapy. She ends up in Professor Thomas Abrams\\' poetry class and immediately realizes she is in way over her head. He is rude to her and sees through her charade. \\n But Thomas has secrets, too. Yes he is married but there is much, much more to his story than just that simple fact.

He is also the teaching assistant for the writing class. The goal of the class is to write a book by the end of the course. \\n \"Come on.

He is unsure if he is reading the signals wrong, or if Sebastian is just deeply closeted. Sebastian helps Tanner with his book. Could it be even remotely possible that Sebastian is gay? \\n \"But how can I send my heart to him when he\\'s just said, in no uncertain terms, that he doesn\\'t speak its language?\" \\n My heart ached for Sebastian and Tanner. Yes they did fall in love. And Sebastian\\'s religion made him feel worthless and unloved by God and rejected by his family. He struggled with his feelings but knew that his family would never, ever accept his sexual orientation. So perfect from the outside, his family was actually intensely judgmental. \\n I adored Tanner and the sweet romance that developed between these two. This is not a steamy romance at all but it was very passionate and sweet and believable and REAL. While the beliefs of the Mormon church sometimes felt like they were being recited from a textbook, I understood how Sebastian could be so torn between his service to the Church, and his desire to live an authentic life. How beautiful it was that he finally found someone to love. \\n There are no evil characters here. Sebastian\\'s parents simply see no other path for their son other than his upcoming missionary work for three years. That is what they did, and that is what is expected of Sebastian. This book is about having the courage to stand up for your principles and for who you are. When Sebastian finally realizes that, he has already broken Tanner\\'s heart. This book is a journey that asks some tough and heartbreaking questions along the way. \\n Seb and Tanner were hot for each other. It was a healthy exploration of their sexuality, but Seb\\'s parents got to him and influenced him break up with Tanner. \\n These are two sweet, loyal, kind and funny boys. They deserve happiness! I think it is hard for most people to accept a church that basically cuts parents off from their own children based on who they love. \\n Overall I enjoyed the book because Tanner and Seb were so endearing and brave. I felt that the constant reminder that Tanner was a \"half-Jew in a Mormon town\" was overused, I got it the first 3 times it was mentioned . (Also not a fan of the new trend of placing a Nordstrom in virtually town in books. That takes me out of the book. If that part is fictional, what else about the LDS is made up? That\\'s my dilemma.) \\n Hopefully the LDS Church will have a \"revelation\" soon about coming out as gay or bi so that all of the wonderful young people can lead a full life with the love and acceptance of their families, friends and church. \\n \"To think that God loves the trees, but condemns that blossoming thing they do in the spring.\" \\n ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)')\n",

And this book was a perfectly sexy, fast-paced and truly engrossing story. And the cover...WOW!! One of my favorite covers ever and that is very important to me in deciding whether to read a book. \\n The description is fabulous and the first half of the book was really fantastic. Just what I love in a contemporary romance. Valentina has been hurt by her husband William, and decides to stay in Paris alone when William cancels his travel plans there. Their trip was going to be an effort to reconnect as husband and wife, and re-kindle their love for each other. \\n Valentina has become somewhat lost in her marriage, and feels that Paris will give her freedom and the opportunity to find her true self once again. She feels herself growing stronger as a person every day, and falls in love with the city. \\n \"My arms outstretched, I\\'d danced to the vibrant music of life.

A sexy French artist, what could be bad, non? Wellllll....besides stating that he was an artist and mentioning one or two of his paintings, there was no discussion of the art scene in Paris, what his artistic process was, just, nothing. I would have loved some discussion of his art. Something to fill out this part of the storyline. \\n But I digress. Valentina meets the gorgeous and mysterious Sebastien and the two really connect.

The plot just descended for me into soap-opera territory and was reminiscent of a favorite movie of mine - but it just didn\\'t work for me here.

I will always read what Mia writes and eagerly look forward to her next books! \\n Favorite quote: \\n \"Il n\\'y a qu\\'un bonheur dans la vie, c\\'est d\\'aimer et d\\'etre aime.\" There is only one happiness in life, to love and be loved. \\n Our bodies are covered in sweat.

The answer to that question unfolds slowly over the course of the book. We learn that Laura and Kit witnessed an violent assault during an eclipse festival years earlier and were witnesses for the prosecution during the trial of the attacker, Jamie. The trial was emotionally draining and physically exhausting for everyone and is described in minute detail. \\n The brutal assault is also described in vivid detail so I was curious as to how any doubt could arise about Jamie\\'s guilt or innocence.

She had befriended them after the trial of her attacker, but then became wildly unstable. Laura and Kit became convinced they had to disappear \"off the grid\" so that she would never find them again. \\n This book was incredibly gripping and thought-provoking. It is told over the course of many years and features vivid characters and brilliantly-researched settings. The author forces the reader to confront their own morals and ask: What would you do in the same situation? \\n \"Until that day I\\'d been thinking about the campaign in binary terms: either Jamie was in denial, or he was calling the world\\'s bluff. But now a third possibility was inescapable, and one in which I was horrifically culpable. What if Jamie was innocent?\" \\n This book was addictive and wildly surprising. The references to eclipses are fascinating and the format of the book is divided into the parts of an eclipse.

BB discovers that Ken may have secretly read parts of her journal, and when he does, things get MUCH spicier and hotter between them. Thrilled with Ken\\'s newfound interest in sex, BB decides to embellish the stories of her past boyfriends. The writing is absolutely charming and hilarious, written as if BB was talking to a best friend. I was really hoping for Ken to wake up and take an interest in his marriage because it was obvious they had amazing chemistry together. \\n What he does have is a Captain America-style square jaw with a subtle cleft and a permanent five o\\'clock shadow. He also has enviously high cheekbones. His aqua-blue eyes are hooded by long espresso-colored lashes, and his sandy-brown hair is just long enough on top to allow for a good grip. His physique is lean yet muscular. His sense of humor is dry. He is brilliant and self-deprecating, and he has the ability to skip rocks across any body of water (a secret turn-on of mine). \\n This book is best enjoyed with glass or two of wine. I can\\'t believe this is BB Easton\\'s debut book! Each of her past boyfriends was charming, dangerous, sweet and sexy in their own way. I loved the descriptions of teenage first love and the \\'80s references were priceless. BB Easton is nothing if not brutally honest. Her descriptions of married life and babies are spot-on. Everyone can relate to this story! BB spends much of the book hoping that her straight-laced husband will get her name visibly tattooed somewhere on his body.

I just also want him to f*ck my brains out. \\n This is a very funny book, written with great sensitivity and a sharp eye for detail. BB Easton has already written the next book in this series which is about her boyfriend Knight. What a character!! I can\\'t wait to read his story, \\'Skin.\\' I was pleasantly surprised by this wild and crazy story! After reading this, I feel like BB Easton is an old friend. I love her writing style!

And I am a HUGE fan of Pepper Winters. First of all, this cover is absolutely stunning. I would read this book based on the cover alone. And I love the chemistry between the two MC\\'s in this story. And as usual, Pepper creates a strong-willed, kick-ass heroine who is smart, driven and beautiful. \\n The story is promising: Elle is assaulted as a young teenager by a gang of thugs in New York and is rescued by a mysterious stranger. Sadly, she never sees his face and can\\'t help him as he is carted off by the police that night. But she never forgets the man who saved her life and with whom she spent a few very memorable hours. \\n Fast forward years later and Elle is the head of a large retail company. She is single but her father tries to fix her up with nearly every eligible bachelor he meets. But when Elle and Penn meet, she is taken by his dark good looks and dominating personality. \\n Fierce eyebrows gave expression and authority to the intensity of his dark brown eyes. Dark hair bordering on black curled around his cheeks, forehead, and ears, speaking of wildness rather than tamed. His strong nose and refined cheekbones were perfect adornments to the beard bordering his lips. \\n Penn is dangerous, for sure, but nevertheless alluring to the sheltered Elle. She hasn\\'t had much real-world experience and she finds Penn incredibly sexy. \\n I narrowed my eyes. \"What do you want from me?\" \\n He smiled, his mouth once again bewitching me. \"Not sure yet.\" \\n Who is Penn? Can he be trusted? He quite literally sweeps Elle off her feet. Set against the backdrop of New York City, this darkly sexy story is classic Pepper Winters. Everyone has secrets and nothing is at it seems. \\n Pulling away, he rested his forehead on mine, a roguish smile replacing his grimace. \"I\\'m not letting you go. I\\'ve only just found you.\" \\n Some of the plot points of the story fell a little flat for me and took me out of the story. Other readers seem to overlook these issues so if you are a fan of dark romance, then give this one a go! Although this story ends with a cliffhanger, the next book should be coming out soon and I am curious to see where these characters end up.')\n",

It is hard to explain when a book has that certain spark that makes it memorable but whatever it is, The Butterfly Project has it all. The writing is beautiful and there is plenty of steam but it is believable and very explosive when Beckett and Zelda finally get together. \\n \"...I realized you could get used to anything--even being alone for years -- right until the moment you touched something better than what you had.\" \\n A very sexy and emotional story, The Butterfly Project is one of my favorite books.

This house might be simple, but it\\'s ambition is extraordinary.\" \\n A fantastic psychological thriller that I could not put down!! Would you be willing to give up almost all of your worldly possessions for a chance live in a stunning home for very little rent? That is the fascinating premise of this book by JP Delaney, a pseudonym for a well-known writer. I read that the author did not want to reveal his/her gender because the book is told from a female point of view. I did not know this when I first read a sample, and the author succeeded in making me feel as though I was inside the narrators\\' minds. \\n The brilliant architect Edward Monkford has designed One Folgate Street in London, a high-tech house with cutting edge design. Edward is a follower of minimalism to the extreme, so much so that the tenants must agree to abide by his extreme de-cluttering rules and regulations. But he sees his rules as so much more than control and firmly believes that a house really can change you from within. If you have to de-clutter your life, then you will begin to see what is truly important in life, and you will free your mind to become a better person. \\n Emma and Jane are both looking for a fresh start. They are required to fill out a stringent and lengthy application in order to pass on to the final level of approval, which is a very brief meeting with the owner and designer of One Folgate Street. The rent is low and the house is located in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood. \\n Edward is difficult, mysterious, brilliant, moody...but the chance to live in the magnificent home is so tempting, the women overlook all of this in order for a chance to live at One Folgate Street. The home is equipped with the latest high-tech gadgets, and the tenants must answer periodic questionnaires in order to continue living in the house. The evaluations test their ethics, their physical well-being and their state of mind and are quite literally crucial to continues living in the house. \\n \"That\\'s all anyone\\'s looking for really, isn\\'t it? Someone to take care of the mess inside our heads?\" \\n The descriptions of the home are absolutely enthralling. I am still thinking about this book weeks after finishing! The idea of extreme de-cluttering is very thought-provoking and is woven inextricably into this intriguing story. Is Edward as dangerous and unhinged as everyone seems to think he is? This is a classic tale where NOTHING is as it seems. I literally read this book over the course of 2 days and was shocked by the surprising conclusion. \\n The story is told from the point of view of Emma, who is seeking a safe neighborhood and a secure home after a recent break-in, and Jane, who has suffered a tragic loss and is seeking a new beginning. Their stories converge in a creative way and I loved how the author kept me guessing until the very last page. The house literally plays a central role in this book and to me is one of the main characters in this story. If you are looking for a thrilling read that will challenge you and your boundaries, then \"The Girl Before\\' is for you!! I LOVED it and highly recommend it for all fans of domestic thrillers. \\n (Copy provided by the publisher via NetGalley.)')\n",

Reiss's writing and I know that not every book is for every reader. SO, although I love her trademark staccato-style of writing, it just didn't work for me here. This book seemed to be written more in the style of a screenplay, which is fine, but the rapid shifting between dialogue and settings was disorienting for me. \\n I didn't really connect with the MC's until late in the book and I wanted to feel a connection not only TO them, but BETWEEN them. And the near-constant discussion of bodily functions was just very uninteresting to me. Would this make a cute movie? Absolutely. It just didn't work for me as a romance novel. \\n The stereotyping of wealthy Hollywood insiders and the way they raise their children and constantly chase after their staff was also very uninteresting to me. I did enjoy the latter half of the book and loved the way Brad grew as a person and as a new father to Nicole. I am definitely in the minority on this book so by all means give this one a try if you love books about single dads and Hollywood superstars. C.D.

I love stories where the main protagonists are imperfect characters. James and Madison make poor choices in their lives, but somehow the author makes it all seem very believable and just plain real.

This couple built a solid foundation so that when they eventually got together, it was simply beautiful. \\n \\'Wait for It\" was the kind of book that I simply could not wait to get back to. Isn\\'t that the best kind of story? If you are looking for a passionate story about two grown-ups who have lived and loved and lost, then pick up this book.

Alex is now a well-known photographer and he played a pivotal role in Brooke\\'s life when she was in college studying abroad in France. \\n Not quite fluent in French, Brooke finds herself struggling with the language when she first arrives.

Imagine not needing different words for love and like, half the girls I knew practically lived and died by the nuance.\" \\n The beautiful and gifted Sophie, another American student, befriends Brooke and they become very close. Brooke cannot understand what Sophie sees in her but Sophie is not quite the perfect, gifted student athlete that everyone assumes her to be. Both girls see their time in France as a way to break free of the confines of their lives back home in America. \\n They become fast friends with Veronique and soon, her sexy cousin Alex, a photographer. Their family, while very glamorous, is also very dysfunctional. The dynamics are fascinating and Brooke is swept off her feet by the bohemian and free-thinking Alex. He surrounds himself with gorgeous models and artists but insists that he can see beyond the superficial. Brooke feels beautiful when she is with him and with Sophie. \\n \"...people see what they want to see. You will see what you want to see.\" \\n Alex quite literally sweeps Brooke off her feet. His family owns homes all over France and the girls embark on a series of adventures with him and his family in Paris, Cap Ferrat and Nantes. If you have ever visited France, or just want to visit, this book will serve as a stunning travelogue to the magnificent country! I could almost hear the noises of Paris and feel the warmth of the Mediterranean sun. Brooke is entranced with Alex and quickly falls under his spell. \\n \"It occurred to me that men like Alex knew how to make entrances, knew how to make you wait just long enough that you found yourself in touch with the exact despair you\\'d feel if they were to abandon you, then they\\'d show up to save the day a moment later and fill you with the joy of their presence, the relief of having been rescued from their absence.\" \\n This story rockets to a stunning conclusion that was both inevitable and surprising all at once. It is a very powerful tale of friendship, love and second chances. The use of French throughout the book was perfect. I\\'m obsessed with this book! Perfectly written. And the cover is gorgeous. Did it make me painfully nostalgic for my twenties? Yes. I feel lost without these characters! A slow-build story that I won\\'t soon forget. \\n \"But\" - Sophie bit the edge of her lip as if she could hardly contain her smile - \"it\\'s going to be different for us. We\\'re going to chose.

I was first introduced to this author with \\'Road-Tripped\\', an eccentric, zany but very sexy and warm-hearted romantic comedy. In \\'Head-Tripped\\' we meet another very original cast of characters who have a sweet, sweet slow build romance. \\n Effie is a brilliant violinist who was a child prodigy. She spent her childhood suffering under the weight of an overbearing mother and longing for a \"normal\" life. She moves to New York City for a fresh start and to try to escape the demons of her past. She is asked to stand in for her twin sister Callie (from \\'Road Tripped\\') at an awards show and there she meets an insanely hot guy who captures her attention. \\n Elias just happens to be a world-famous rock star but Effie has led such a sheltered life that she has no idea who he is! Elias LOVES that about her. Especially when she thinks he could be a homeless guy with no job! Elias is suffering from writer\\'s block and thinks Effie might just be the shot in the arm that his band Urban needs. \\n Effie has a lot of demons in her past and she is not completely honest with Elias at first. He has one hard and fast rule about his relationships and Effie is afraid she will lose him forever if he learns the truth about her. \\n \"This wasn\\'t going to last. Bliss never lasted - it disappeared in an instant.\" \\n Elias brings Effie on the band\\'s world tour and they are a huge hit. Effie is a brilliant musician and she and Elias truly make beautiful music together. I loved these two characters - real, flawed, imperfect and very quirky. Both of them are searching for real, honest love. Would they both be able to overcome their past demons and the people who would stop at nothing to break then apart? \\n I LOVE how the author puts quotes at the beginning of each chapter, along with a fantastic playlist of songs that fit each chapter perfectly! Reading this book was a pure delight. It almost read like a travelogue at times as the band Urban travels all over the world to exotic locales on their concert tour. Effie truly is someone you would want as a best friend. This book is funny, sexxxxy, warm-hearted and very, very clever.

Part of the Manwhore series, this book can absolutely stand on its own but favorite characters from the earlier books do make appearances here. Olivia is starting a new internship at Carma, Inc. and is determined to make a name for herself at the company. Even though her brother Tahoe helped her get the job, she is very driven and wants to make a great impression. \\n Callan and Olivia fall for each other very quickly, and even though they both know their relationship can't really go anywhere because of the nature of their working relationship, they feel an undeniable connection. Their dialogue and flirting is sexy and fun and Olivia doesn't expect them to last beyond the length of her summer internship. \\n Lots of readers will love 'Womanizer' for the main characters' chemistry, the settings and the feisty heroine. I enjoyed it as light and steamy story. If you are looking for a quick and upbeat romance with a super-hot hero, I would recommend this book. I loved the Chicago setting and smart heroine.

Luke is an image consultant and works with his clients to make them more confident. T.

She begins to chafe in her perfect little bubble. \\n \"I can prepare dinner and I have on occasion, but he always insists we ask Penny, which irritates me. I have all day in this echoing apartment, my own voice bouncing off the sterile, bare walls and marble floors. Sometimes I wonder if uselessness can kill a person.\" \\n Zoe is witty, sarcastic and smart, and all of the characters were engaging and interesting. I loved her connection with Henry, and even though she was in love with him, she never quite felt that she really \"knew\" him at all. \\n \"Henry is a product of a traditional household and paternalism runs deep in his veins, which I find both charming and a little infuriating, depending on the day.\" \\n But is Zoe just imagining things where they do not exist? Henry is the perfect husband and all he wants to do is please her. The author did a great job at creating characters I really cared about. With all his odd mannerisms, Henry seems to be in love with his wife and do everything for her. After a charity event, Zoe begins to question her past and seeks out certain people that she had thought were long gone from her life.

This oddly appealing story of a therapist\\'s rapid fall from grace was recommended by one of my favorite writers, Varian Krylov. So I just knew I had to read this! \\n Dr. Crane begins treating Max, who very early on establishes himself as at the very least, amoral, and at the worst, a sociopath. But Crane, who is an inexperienced therapist just out of school, falls quickly under his patient Max\\'s spell. \\n \"Are you afraid of me, Dennis? You shouldn\\'t be. I\\'m trying my very best to make you understand that I like you. And I\\'m offering you the very thing you desire the most: me. You know I\\'m a fine specimen of amorality. I\\'m giving you the opportunity to look behind the curtain. No holding back.\" \\n The levels of depravity this story sinks to are quite extreme. But I found the book to be surprisingly engaging and very well-written. Dr. Crane knew he was addicted to Max, yet he simply could not stop his increasingly twisted behavior. \\n He felt strangely light and calm, as if he\\'d used up all of his fear and trepidation and was left with nothing but serene acceptance. Maybe this was what Max felt like all the time. \\n This book is dark to the nth degree. But if you\\'re in the mood for a bizarre and perverted story with some very black humor, then \\'Max\\' might be just what you\\'re looking for. You have been warned!')\n",

It seems that no one cared much for Mia, so much so that no one was sure she was actually missing as opposed to just being irresponsible.

The only one who seems to really care about her is her captor. \\n Lots of readers didn\\'t like the jumping back and forth in time in the narration but I felt it added a sense of disorientation which was necessary in the book. All in all, a sturdy thriller hat kept me turning the pages all night. I cannot believe \\'The Good Girl\\' is the first book by Mary Kubica! I cannot wait to read her other books!')\n",

Their lives are intertwined with Walt and Clare. I adored Roman\\'s sexy, uber-alpha ways. BUT there were too many inconsistencies in the story for me.

Sweet and sugary but sexy and romantic, too. I devoured this confection of a story. I am absolutely floored that this was a debut novel! Every line was funnier than the one before.

I am very picky about office romances because (a) I work in an office, and (b) they are usually so unrealistic and overly simple. Not \\'The Hating Game\\'. The author nails the workplace setting perfectly. \\n Lucy and Josh HATE each other. Like, they can\\'t even stand to be in the same room together. But they share an office! They are complete opposites in every way. He is cold and controlling, she is warm and friendly. He is REALLY tall, she is VERY petite. They tease each other incessantly. \\n \"Stop calling me Shortcake.\" \\n \"Watching you pretend to hate that nickname is the best part of my day.\" \\n The writing in this book was absolutely hilarious.

Carter is sexy as hell, a gorgeous pilot, and right then Kendall makes a rash decision that will change her life. Yes, Carter has had a wild past but he is completely honest with Kendall and does not try to hide his past.

All of the ingredients for a great read! \\n \"If you lie enough times, no one believes your truth.\" \\n This book is Alessandra Torre at her best: no-nonsense, smart and engaging fiction. Helena is a very unlikely heroine, prickly, moody and basically angry at the world. She doesn\\'t want to rely on anyone at all. She even keeps her long-time agent Kate at arm\\'s length. \\n \"On rare days, Kate regrets ever meeting the woman. But on most days, she just wonders about her. They say all geniuses are a little mad. Maybe Helena\\'s madness just took longer to come out.\" \\n But Helena as a story to tell and she doesn\\'t have much time to do it. She sets her sights on one writer, and one writer only, to become her ghostwriter. A competing romance author, Marka writes books that Helena actually despises. But she sees a talent there that would be perfect for her own story. \\n \"What\\'s happened to me? I have a story that I don\\'t have time to tell. I have an empty house that reeks of death.

I\\'m dying, and it\\'s the best thing that has happened to me in a long time.\" \\n Alessandra Torre builds the suspense perfectly in this book, all while holding the reader\\'s attention and slowly revealing the terrible secret about Helena\\'s life. This book is also a fascinating glimpse into the lonely life of a writer and the almost obsessive need to get the words out at all costs. \\n \"You can tell them who you are, or what your job in the book was. I don\\'t mind if they know I\\'ve had help.\" \\n They. The gods in their world, the eyes on which the axis rotated. The readers. The critics. What would they think? \\n This is most definitely not a romance but the main characters are both renowned romance writers.

They don\\'t lean closer or want more.\" \\n I absolutely loved this book. Once I started I could not put it down. I applaud the author for creating a heroine who is far from loveable yet completely and utterly captivating. No question that astute readers will figure out the terrible secret before the surprising conclusion, but this book is a total winner nonetheless. It is completely original and inventive.

On the day he unveils it, he is very publicly hacked and the program is shut down. How could this happen to what is supposed to be a non-crackable code? Taylor tracks down the location of the hacker and attempts to find out. \\n Going from the world of Silicon Valley to Small Town USA is quite a shock to Taylor. In what is part suspense and part sexy contemporary romance, C.D. Reiss spins a tale of two brilliant characters who are from different worlds, yet are very much alike. \\n After much sleuthing, Taylor uncovers the identity of the hacker and it turns out the hacker is a she: the very beautiful, passionate, sensitive and talented Harper. Taylor and Harper fall into a hot and sexy relationship and it turns our they are really very much alike. All Taylor wants is his code back and then he can get out of the suffocating town of Barrington. But Harper has other ideas. What is she after? Revenge? For what? Or is she simply after money? \\n \"Was she playing some kind of game? No matter how many ways I peeled this onion, I couldn\\'t get to the center. Was she after my heart? Had she changed the fucking rules?\" \\n C.D. Reiss writes in a trademark staccato, no-nonsense style which I love. Her words are witty and to the point. I felt, however, I needed a little more connection between Taylor and Harper even though I enjoyed their sexy times. This story had the potential for me to be a great book, but it needed more detail to the plot. Certain plot points felt too abrupt to me and I would have liked them to have been more fleshed out. But Ms. Reiss is a terrific romance writer and the scenes between Taylor and Harper were HAWT!! \\n \"Nothing had ever felt that good. Nothing except falling on her and burying my face in her neck, drinking in the scent of infinite possibilities.\" \\n There is social commentary woven in here about the decline of small town economies in the US as well as the difficulties faced by women in the tech world. But the heart of the story is Taylor and Harper and their chemistry together. Taylor is much more than simply Harper\\'s boyfriend; he is her other half. \\n \"I\\'m your mate. A boyfriend can be stolen. A mate can\\'t.\" \\n Will Taylor find the solution to the hack? Will Harper help him or will she refuse to give up her secrets? Can these two possibly find happiness together? \\n I am a huge fan of C.D. Reiss and her books are among my favorites. But for me, I simply couldn\\'t connect with the characters in \\'King of Code\\' and didn\\'t buy into the demise of the town of Barrington. I am going to assume all of the tech talk is accurate because that is way over my pay grade! \\n My pet peeve is naming fictional characters after people IRL. That takes me right out of a story. (How about sending flowers or a signed book to the friend you want to thank or honor? Is that absolutely unheard of?) Obviously this is peculiar to me but it does affect my enjoyment of a book. \\n Many early readers love this book so definitely give it a try if you\\'re looking for a romantic mystery/suspense story with a side of sexy! \\n \"You belong to me.

Even though she is very young and naive, she dutifully goes along with her father's plan.

Each one of their encounters is laced with danger. I definitely want to read more about Santo: he could have an entire book written just from his point of view! Handsome, dominating and smart, Lucrezia can't resist him. \\n This is without a doubt a violent mafia romance but yet it is not quite as bloody or strange as some of the books I've read by this duo. Lucrezia is almost an old-fashioned woman, from the way she dresses to her speech to her mannerisms. And even though Santo lives in a world of constant violence, he was sexy and romantic and almost tender with the beautiful Lucrezia. \\n 'Blood & Marriage' is a super fast-paced and spicy read, with all of the trademark sexual tension and wonderfully descriptive writing I have come to expect from Miss Merikan.

She is under tremendous pressure to succeed and her father is not her biggest fan. Hayden races for a competitor and he is strictly off-limits to Kenzie. She is downright mean to him at first, and they have a love-hate thing going on that was very intense. Kenzie has a lot of preconceived notions about Hayden which, of course, turn out to be completely wrong. Hayden is sex--on-wheels and he and Kenzie begin a Romeo-and-Juliet romance that must be kept hidden from everyone. \\n Hayden is also an incredibly talented racer and Kenzie realizes she can learn a lot from him. They both actually race better when they are competing against each other. I absolutely love that the author created a female racer who is smart, strong and competitive in a traditionally male sport. Hayden is a DREAM and their scenes together are beautiful, sexxxxy and very believable.

      "('98', '01ec1a320ffded6b2dd47833f2c8e4fb', '28119217', 5, '\"I\\'m cold. I\\'m hungry. I\\'m frightened.\" \\n And so begins this extraordinary story of Elsa and Thibault, who meet purely by accident while she is in a coma. The story is vibrant and alive even though much of is it set in a hospital. \\n Elsa was a fearless and experienced mountain climber who was critically injured in a tragic climbing accident. The accident left her in a coma from which it seems that she will never awaken. \\n \"Elsa is the mountains. When you walk across a mountain with her it\\'s like seeing her and it stripped bare. Open to possibilities. All her emotions are raw. She\\'s wonderful.\" \\n Elsa is trapped within her own body but she can hear everything around her. She guesses that she is in a hospital but she can\\'t feel anything. She can hear her parents approach her hospital bed, but she can only guess that they kiss her on the cheek or touch her arm. She can hear her sister\\'s constant chattering, but cannot feel if someone moves her or adjusts her tubes. \\n Elsa desperately wants to move and to cry out but she can\\'t even feel her vocal chords so she does not know if she even has the ability to speak. Into this world literally stumbles Thibault, who is trying to escape his own personal hell: his brother has caused a terrible accident and Thibault cannot bring himself to visit yet. \\n I was incredibly moved by this story and the touches of beauty and humanity and even humor. I was astounded by the ethical questions this book raises about hospital care and outraged by the sometimes careless way that Elsa was treated, even by her family. \\n \"They are whispering to each other. I hate it. You\\'d think they had just stepped into a mortuary. I want to cry out that I\\'m still here, alive, right next to them, but they carry on talking in low voices as though they don\\'t want me to hear them.\" \\n Thibault is the only one who treats Elsa like a human being and speaks to her normally. She is a bright spot in Thibault\\'s life and he finds her extraordinarily beautiful even in her absolute stillness. Elsa begins to crave his visits and longs for the moment when she can move or even open her eyes to see him. \\n \"...Thibault is different. He\\'s my secret. He\\'s my breath of fresh air. Even though I don\\'t have a clue what he looks like.\" \\n I\\'m Still Here is a very powerful debut from Clelie Avit. It is an incredibly thought-provoking and humane story that can be read in one sitting. I was absolutely enthralled from the very beginning and highly recommend this very unusual and satisfying book! \\n \"I\\'m in love with a girl in a coma. And for the moment, it seems like the most sensible thing that has ever happened to me.\" \\n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)')\n",
      "('99', '01ec1a320ffded6b2dd47833f2c8e4fb', '30320682', 4, '3.5 - 4 Stars \\n Written in an unusually quirky style, Professed is a student/teacher romance about Ben, a college professor and 20-year-old Naomi. I will admit that it took me some time to get into this story, but once I did, I was engrossed in this very hot and at times very funny taboo romance. \\n First, heed the warnings about this book and be aware that this story is VERY explicit! Ben and Naomi meet at a secret masked ball and immediately begin a passionate affair. Dr. Ben Beck is a philosophy professor who has written a book and has been invited to join the faculty at Yale. He has always questioned the existence of love and now ironically, now finds himself head over heels in love with the smart and beautiful Naomi. \\n Once they become aware that Naomi is Ben\\'s student, they are acutely aware of the risks they are taking. Naomi could lose her place at Yale andBen could lose his position on the faculty, at the very least. But this is actually a very fast-paced book and the author\\'s brisk writing style and sense of humor make this a very readable story. \\n \"Forbidden fruit is always the sweetest.\" \\n There are lots of things I loved about this book and some, not so much. I loved reading about Naomi\\'s background and her family: she was raised by her father, a lobsterman in a New England town and she struggles to pay her way through college and to fit in at Yale. I would have loved to read more about Ben\\'s background! The book is told in alternating POV\\'s and the humor and brisk writing style lightens up the very explicit scenes. \\n Naomi\\'s character was unusually mature for her age. Although I did not have an issue with the age gap, I was not totally convinced what a 38-year-old would find so alluring and compelling about a college junior. I would have also loved to have known more about the \"secret society\" masked ball where Naomi and Ben first met. \\n I loved Naomi\\'s best friend Lucy and I know her story will be hilarious! This is certainly not your average student-teacher forbidden romance and for that, I applaud the author. Overall, Professed is a very sexy, very enjoyable and promising debut story. \\n ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.')\n",

'Mechanic' is one of my favorites. So I was very excited to read their first full-length book. Unfortunately this story just didn't do it for me. The overly-possessive, controlling and bossy hero didn't even bother me at all; in fact he's a part of this writing duo's charm! Oz knew what he wanted and he went after her. What bothered me was that the heroine was a Yale grad but she sure didn't act like one. In addition, I had several issues with the plot which sadly interfered with my enjoyment of the story. And when did Nordstrom come to Manhattan? (Answer: it didn't. Nordstrom Rack doesn't count.) I'll continue to buy and read Alexa Riley's books, but this one was a miss for me.\")\n"
